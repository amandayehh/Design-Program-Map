MICA,"Graphic design is one of the most powerful forms of communication. Design is commercial, social, public, and political. It shapes the meaning and impact of books, magazines, apps, websites, posters, advertisements, games, logos, film titles, and countless other media. Everywhere you look, designers are using words and images to penetrate people's hearts and minds. Our program shapes designers to think conceptually and apply technical skills in all forms of design practice. We see graphic design as a comprehensive activity of visual problem solving for professional leaders working in branding, UI/UX, packaging, spatial design, publication design, and typeface design, among others. Our graduates bring the ability to think and make critically and to thrive as professional designers.In MICA's Graphic Design major, you will gain the creative, technical, and intellectual skills to become the design visionary of the future while shaping the form and content of media — from magazines and books to websites and social media applications. The graphic design curriculum at MICA is built around a three-year sequence of core design courses. Required courses in typography, paired with comprehensive studios, help our students build expertise. Theory, technique and history are tied into every course. A broad palette of electives in specialized areas is offered, for students both inside and outside of the major.A senior degree project is required, in which students create an independent body of work that expresses their identities and interests. Pre-professional experiences are required for juniors and seniors—providing lessons on career development strategies. These courses draw from the expertise of leading design professionals across the east coast who advise students and support them in their professional development."
RISD,"The undergraduate program in Graphic Design allows students to fully absorb an informed design process that provides lifelong support as they go on to engage in real-world design opportunities. Students gain a thorough understanding of the principles of design, theories of communication and strategies for problem solving. Learning outcomes.The program educates students to become resourceful designers engaged in reflexive, responsible and sustainable practices. Graduates are prepared to:evaluate and critique the effectiveness of visual communication work respond to a communication need by determining an appropriate perspective and following through by form-making using various means: editing, aesthetics and/or appropriation develop and refine personal methods that culminate in a cohesive body of work targeting professional practice, an independent studio practice and/or entrepreneurship work with contemporary and historical tools and software Inspiring community Despite being one of the largest departments at RISD, Graphic Design offers approximately 165 undergraduate majors countless opportunities to collaborate within and beyond the discipline. MFA candidates in the department work in a separate facility but interact with undergraduates as TAs and informal mentors who appreciate all opportunities to engage in meaningful exchange about graphic communication. Learning environment Graphic Design majors work in dedicated studios in the Design Center, where they have access to a wide array of digital and traditional printing and photographic resources, as well as specialized facilities for bookbinding, papermaking and screenprinting. Faculty members assign challenging projects covering everything from designing books, magazines and posters to UX and websites, film graphics, identities, packaging and exhibits. Each year dozens of visiting designers and critics spend time at RISD complementing the talents of resident faculty and offering alternative design perspectives from around the world.The core curriculum in Graphic Design builds a range of analytical, formal, sensory and technical design experiences. Sophomores begin exploring visual principles of form, image, color and typography. Conceptual thinking in areas such as communication theory, visual systems and information design forms the focus of the junior year. During senior year, emphasis is placed on design applications, with a range of electives available to expose students to specific areas of graphic design practice. Juniors and seniors also have opportunities to pursue professional internships over the summer or during the semester.Graphic Design at RISD provides a comprehensive education that pushes on the boundaries of the discipline. Students learn how to communicate ideas visually, play with the tools of the field, frame points of view and messages, build community and embrace a fluid, networked culture. Faculty support these explorations and encourage ambitious ideas along with a mastery of traditional practices.In the studio students learn the fundamental value of typography, imagery, grids, systems and more in the course of creating everything from traditional books, posters, logos and websites to apps, interactive texts and other digital media. "
CMU,"Bachelor of Design The Bachelor of Design (BDes) degree is a four-year degree that offers three tracks for specialization: Products (industrial design), Communications (graphic design), and Environments (both physical and digital). Our curriculum emphasizes the importance of designing for interactions between people, the built world, and the natural world. (Learn more about our program framework.) Working in collaborative, dedicated studio spaces, students cultivate skills and learn design theories, methods, and processes that help develop and refine their ideas. They craft objects, communicate concepts, and develop complex systems that facilitate meaningful interactions. Customize your degree. Carnegie Mellon has one of the only undergraduate programs in design that enables students to customize their degree. You can choose to keep a fairly narrow focus in order to develop deep expertise, or take a broad approach that results in a more interdisciplinary concentration. The diagram below shows just two example pathways that students might chart through the curriculum. The first year of the program introduces students to all three design tracks: Communications (C), Products (P), and Environments (E). This year of study is intended to provide broad exposure, allowing students to gradually adjust their path as their interests become clearer and talents emerge. By the third semester, students begin to focus their attention on two preferred tracks. Starting in the spring of their Sophomore year, studio courses focus on a single track at a time. By choosing among these courses, students develop expertise in a single track, or expand their range of experience by choosing two of the three. In the final two semesters of study, students work in multi-disciplinary teams and apply disciplinary expertise to capstone projects in the areas of Design for Service (Sv) and/or Design for Social Innovation (Si). Again, they have the opportunity to work on projects in both areas, or focus on a single area to deepen their exploration. In the spring each year, the School of Design hosts Confluence, a career event attended by more than 70 top companies. Confluence helps our students land summer internships (particularly after the second and third years in the program), adding real world design experience to their growing list of credentials. Study abroad opportunities are also available to students during the junior year. Undergraduate Degrees Why design? At its heart, design is about solving problems. It’s no wonder businesses and institutions are embracing the value of design, and the demand for design professionals has never been greater. In our undergraduate programs, you will learn to design products (industrial design), communications (graphic design), and environments (both physical and digital). Our graduates go on to positions with leading companies, design firms, start-ups, and nonprofits. Some start their own businesses, while others become design researchers and educators. The career possibilities—and your potential to make a positive impact on the world—are limitless. What kind of designer do you want to be? Look around you. Almost everything you see was designed by someone. Products and communications are all around us, and they come together in both physical and digital spaces, or environments. Our undergraduate program offers three complementary tracks in Products, Communications, and Environments. You may choose to specialize in one of the three areas, or pursue a more interdisciplinary focus by combining two of the three. Whether you want to create the next iPad app, the next generation mobile device, a new social networking site, or even a line of sustainable furniture, the BDes degree has you covered. You will learn about the tools, culture, and practice of design. Most importantly, you will learn to see and think design. Customize your degree. As the demand for design increases, so does the range of design expertise. Some designers concentrate in a single area, while others choose to broaden their expertise. Designers frequently work collaboratively in transdisciplinary teams. Our program offers multiple undergraduate degree options, and allows you to customize your degree according to your goals and interests. Undergraduate design majors at Carnegie Mellon earn a Bachelor of Design degree (BDes). This degree is equivalent in rank to a BFA, but acknowledges the growing importance of the design disciplines as separate and distinct from Fine Art. You can customize your degree by choosing among studio courses in each of our three tracks (Products, Communications, and Environments). For students interested in a pursuing a broad liberal arts emphasis, we offer an Interdisciplinary Degree (BXA) and a Minor in Design. The BXA program provides students with the ability to evenly balance their study of humanities or sciences with design, while the design minor is for students admitted to other programs on campus who are interested in gaining fundamental design skills and exposure to design. CMU also offers a unique program called Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology (IDeATe), which allows student to concentrate their studies on cross-campus industry themes like game design, animation and special effects, innovation and entrepreneurship, intelligent environments, and learning media design."
VCU,"The Graphic Design Program offers a 122-credit Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Graphic Design. After completing the Art Foundation Program, students take courses in Publication and Print Design, Sequential and Motion Design, and Interaction Design along with a series of related Studio and Seminar courses. The primary goal of the curriculum is to educate students to be capable of integrating form and information for the purposes of effective visual communication. The Department of Graphic Design encourages the exploration of diverse problem-solving methodologies, innovative investigations and creative research in all forms of communication. It is dedicated to excellence in teaching, scholarship, research and professional practice. The Department provides both an undergraduate and graduate education stressing critical creative and intellectual thinking; awareness of individual, social and cultural issues; the integration of a range of technologies; and a concern for ethical development. The program actively contributes to the school, university, local, state, national and international communities through its scholarly and creative activities, educational programs and service efforts. The sophomore year in the graphic design program is focused on orientation to, and experimentation within, design practice. Students develop processes of making, meaning-building and critical engagement with ideas related to form, medium, materials and tools. This year provides a critical framework to develop a vocabulary allowing them to begin to discuss ideas around information hierarchies and meaning-making as well as legibility and translation. The junior year is focused on experimentation with, and construction of, narrative structures, argument, advocacy and rhetoric (text, text and image, sequence). The underlying social, political and pluralistic demands of graphic design are emphasised. It situates the student and their work/practice within a context and community and introduces methods to facilitate collaboration with those directly and indirectly impacted by the end results of the design process The senior year is focused on deepening, refining and situating individuated experiences; formulatating and synthesizing learning by teaching others through participatory engagement; and building a situated design practice, while understanding that design is inseparable from the culture at large. The student experience in the program culminates in a capstone project that demonstrates their readiness and capacity to engage responsibly and creatively in the field, and is presented in a public exhibition."
ArtCenter,"At ArtCenter, Graphic Design students learn to infuse words and images with life and meaning—whether by creating motion graphics, an interface on the latest mobile device, setting type by hand in our letterpress shop or attending a workshop in our new typography center. Graphic Design has transcended its role as a commercial art practice to become an essential and universal tool for communicating the multi-dimensional experience of a place, product, service or personality in every imaginable context. Our students are challenged to develop design solutions to all of the above by experimenting with a wide range of media—including books and digital magazines, packaging, 3D motion graphics, apps—to create compelling graphic identities and branded experiences. The creative industry is demanding a new generation of graphic designers who can readily stretch their skills across a wide range of analog and digital media to create communication design that successfully cuts through the white noise of our convoluted visual environment. Our curriculum consists of multiple areas of emphasis that reflect the scope of professional opportunities: print and branding, packaging and environmental graphic design, motion and visual interaction design, transmedia, and spatial media. Transmedia Fluency is the term we use to describe our approach to teaching graphic design: a discipline that has transcended its role as commercial art practice to that of an essential and universal tool for communicating the multi-dimensional experience of a place, product, service or personality in every imaginable context. Our curriculum accommodates two different kinds of students and creative personalities: generalists, who want to produce work across the entire scope of communication design, and individuals who are passionate for a very specific media format. For both student types, our program offers a nourishing environment for creative discovery with effective student advisement tools, that help each individual to establish his or her own learning path. We facilitate such a self-curated curriculum through intensive mentorship readily accessible to students. Dedicated faculty directors curate, oversee and mentor each of our graphic design areas of emphasis. Immersed in such a culture, our highly motivated students expand the boundaries of graphic design, thriving in an exploration-centered environment that boldly envisions the future. Consequently, the graduates from our program are highly sought after by the most exciting and disruptive global brands like Uber, Tesla, Google, Facebook, Nike, and creative agencies like IDEO, R/GA, Local Projects and other future-forward organizations."
